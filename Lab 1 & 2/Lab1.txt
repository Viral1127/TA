Html:
Represents the root (top-level element) of an HTML document, so it is also referred to as the root element. All other elements must be descendants of this element.

Body:
--> scripting root
represents the content of an HTML document. There can be only one such element in a document.

Head:
Contains machine-readable information (metadata) about the document, like its title, scripts, and style sheets.

Title:
Defines the document's title that is shown in a browser's title bar or a page's tab. It only contains text; tags within the element are ignored.

Link:
Specifies relationships between the current document and an external resource. 
This element is most commonly used to link to CSS but is also used to establish site icons (both "favicon" style icons and icons for the home screen and apps on mobile devices) among other things.

Meta:
Represents metadata that cannot be represented by other HTML meta-related elements,
like <base>, <link>, <script>, <style> and <title>.


Address:
The <address> HTML element indicates that the enclosed HTML provides contact information for a person or people, or for an organization.
this only designed for writing contact details

Blockquote:

intro:  The <blockquote> HTML element indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation.
        Usually, this is rendered visually by indentation (see Notes for how to change it). 
        A URL for the source of the quotation may be given using the cite attribute,
        while a text representation of the source can be given using the <cite> element.


Table:

intro: The <table> HTML element represents tabular data â€” that is, information presented in a two-dimensional table comprised of rows and columns of cells containing data.
usage:  to diaplay data in tabular format like results, scoreboard, differnet dashboards
        it makes easy to display data in better manner.

Atrributes:

    border: in pixels, to give border
    cellpadding: in pixels, to set padding value to each cell
    cellspacing: in pixels, it specifies space between two cells(means margin).
    bgcolor: in hexacode or predefined color name("red","blue"...)
    align: [left,right,center], to ailgn table with specified position in document.

    for inserting Data:
    table has some nesting child-element like <tr> <th>
    <tr> means table-rows

    this tag has also nesting child elements "<td>" , "<th>"
    td for table data
    th for table heading which is bydefault bold
    by which we write our data

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>name</th>
            <th>id</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>"xyz"</td>
            <td>5</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

in newer version Whole <tr> blocks are nested in <tbody> 
tsble has also different child element
    <caption> to define tables heading
    <footer> to define other info of table in footer of table
